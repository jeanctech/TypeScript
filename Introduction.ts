//? Introduction - TypeScript

/* TypeScript is an open source programming language developed by Microsoft that extends the
JavaScript capabilities by adding a static type system. Here is an introduction to the
  key concepts: */

//* Static typing:

/* One of the most distinctive features of TypeScript is its static type system, which
means that it allows defining types for variables, function parameters, and return values, which
provides more security and error detection during development. */

//* JavaScript superset:

/* TypeScript is a JavaScript superset, which means that all valid JavaScript code is
also TypeScript code. Additionally, it adds new features, but compiles to standard JavaScript for
that can be executed in any browser or environment that supports JavaScript. */

//* Compilation:

/* Code written in TypeScript must be compiled to JavaScript to be executed. This is done
using the TypeScript compiler (tsc), which converts TypeScript code into code
JavaScript. */

//* Main features:

/*
  - **Static types:** Defines types for variables, functions, etc., to avoid errors.
  - **Improved Poo:** Supports classes, interfaces, inheritance and other concepts of object-oriented
  programming.
  - **Decorators:** Allows the addition of metadata to classes, methods, properties, among others.
  - **Structure:** Facilitates the organization and structuring of the code.
  - **Compatibility:** It is compatible with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
*/

/* TypeScript is widely used in web application development, especially in
large scale, where early-stage bug detection and code maintenance are
fundamental. It offers an additional layer of security and maintainability over pure JavaScript. */
