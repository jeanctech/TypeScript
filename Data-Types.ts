//? Data Types - TypeScript

/* In TypeScript, as in JavaScript, there are several data types that can be used to
represent different types of values and entities within a program. Some of the data types
most common in TypeScript are: */

//* Primitive Types:

/*
- **number:** Represents numbers, whether integers or floating point.
- **string:** Represents text strings.
- **boolean:** Represents a logical value, `true` or `false`.
- **null and undefined:** Types that have only one value: `null` and `undefined`, respectively.
- **symbol:** Introduced in ECMAScript 6, represents a unique and immutable data type.
*/

//* Composite Types:

/*
- **Arrays:** Represents an ordered collection of elements of the same type or mixed types.
- **Tuples:** Represents a collection of elements that are not necessarily of the same type.
- **Objects:** Represents an object, with properties and methods.
*/

//* Other types:

/*
- **Any:** Can be assigned to a variable when the type is not known or does not matter.
- **Void:** Represents the absence of type, it is generally used in functions that do not return any value.
*/

//* Advanced Types:

/*
- **Union Types:** Allows a variable to have more than one type.
- **Intersection Types:** Allows you to combine multiple types into a new one.
*/

//* General Types:

/*
- **Typeof:** Allows you to work with types based on the shape of a value, for example using `typeof` to
get the type of a variable.
- **Type Aliases:** Allow you to give names to types, which helps create complex types in a more efficient way.

/* These data types form the basis for defining and manipulating data in TypeScript. The correct one
Understanding and applying these types can improve the clarity, security, and maintainability of a
TypeScript code. */
