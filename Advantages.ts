//? Advantages - TypeScript

// TypeScript offers a number of significant advantages for software development:

//* 1. Static Typing:

/*
     - Provides a static type system that helps detect errors at compile time.
     - Improves code readability and maintainability.
     - Facilitates work in large teams by clarifying data structures and types of
     functions.
*/

//* 2. Development Tools:

/*
     - Provides support for autocompletion, refactoring and error detection in IDEs and editors.
     - Improves productivity by providing feedback and suggestions while writing code.
*/

//* 3. Clear and Concise Writing:

/*
     - Allows you to use arrow functions, destructuring, classes, and other features of Es6/EsNext
      to write clearer and more concise code.
*/

//* 4. Inheritance and Object Orientation:

/*
     - Supports object-oriented programming with classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
*/

//* 5. Interoperability:

/*
     - Compatible with JavaScript, allowing integration with existing libraries and frameworks.
*/

//* 6. Maintainability and Scalability:

/*
     - Reduces the possibility of errors, facilitates refactoring and maintenance of the code in
     large scale projects.
*/

//* 7. Continuous Improvements:

/*
     - TypeScript is a constantly evolving project with frequent updates, which incorporates
     new features and improvements.
*/

//* 8. Active Community:

/*
     - It has a large and active community that provides additional support, resources and tools.
*/

/* The combination of static typing, advanced development tools, clarity of writing
of code and continuous improvements makes TypeScript a popular choice for development projects
of software both small and large. */
