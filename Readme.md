# **TypeScript - Documentation**

## **What is TypeScript?**

### TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, which essentially adds static types and class-based objects. Anders Hejlsberg, C# designer and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript

### **Introduction**

#### TypeScript is used to develop JavaScript applications that will run on the client or server side, or extensions for programs - Node.js and Deno. TypeScript extends the syntax of JavaScript, so any existing JavaScript code should work without problems. It is designed for large projects, which are translated into original JavaScript code through a TypeScript compiler
