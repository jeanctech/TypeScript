## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, which essentially adds static types and class-based objects. Anders Hejlsberg, C# designer and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript

## Introduction

TypeScript is used to develop JavaScript applications that will run on the client or server side, or extensions for programs - Node.js and Deno. TypeScript extends the syntax of JavaScript, so any existing JavaScript code should work without problems. It is designed for large projects, which are translated into original JavaScript code through a TypeScript compiler

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
