//? Environment Configuration - TypeScript

/* Setting up the development environment for TypeScript involves installing TypeScript and
setting up an integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor. Next I'll show you
the basic steps to set up a development environment for TypeScript. */

//* 1. **Install Node.js and npm:**

    /* TypeScript is based on Node.js and uses npm (Node Package Manager) for package installation.
    If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)
    and install it. */

//* 2. **Install TypeScript globally:**

    /* Open a terminal or command line and run the following command to install TypeScript
    globally on your system. */

    //* npm install -g typescript

    /* This will install the TypeScript compiler on your system and allow you to use it from the line
    commands. */

//* 3. **Set up a TypeScript project:**

    /* Create a folder for your TypeScript project and inside it start a TypeScript project
    by running the following command. */

    //* tsc --init

    /* This will generate a `tsconfig.json` file in your folder containing the project configuration.
    You can customize this file to adjust TypeScript settings to your needs. */

//* 4. **Text editor or Ide:**

    /* You can use any text editor or Ide you prefer to write TypeScript code.
    Some popular options for TypeScript development include: */

    /*
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A lightweight and highly customizable IDE that
     includes native support for TypeScript.

    - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/): A JavaScript and TypeScript IDE from JetBrains with
     advanced features.

    - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): A highly customizable text editor with
     Plugins for TypeScript.
     */

//* 5. **Extensions and plugins:**

    /* If you are using a text editor or Ide, install the specific extensions or plugins
    TypeScript for additional features such as syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and checking
    of types in real time. */

//* 6. **Development with TypeScript:**

    /* Now you can start writing TypeScript code in your project. Save your files with
    `.ts` extension, and when you want to compile them to JavaScript, use the following command in the
    terminal. */

    //* tsc

    /* This will compile your TypeScript files to JavaScript based on the settings in `tsconfig.json`.
    You can automate this process with tools like `webpack`, `gulp` or `Grunt`. */

/* With these steps, you will have set up a development environment for TypeScript and are ready to
start writing and compiling TypeScript code. As you work on TypeScript projects, it is
You may want to explore other tools and libraries to help your workflow, such as
package managers, testing tools and project generation tools. */
